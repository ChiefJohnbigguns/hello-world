# hello-world
I'm John and I'm basically learning and entering the Cyberworld @62 years of age, I'm old, but I'm also young!
Why I wqaited so long to enter into this next generation of Cyberspace is still a mystery even to myself. But I'm here now and I'm going to learn what I can do and can't do so my grand children won't run circles around me when they talk about what they're learning.
